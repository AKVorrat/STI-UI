        headline: "In 2015, the European Union adopted legislation on net neutrality..."
      berec_decision_2:
        headline: "The Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications (BEREC) has to prepare implementation guidelines to interpret the ambiguities of the law by the end of August 2016. These guidelines will determine whether Europe will enjoy net neutrality or not."
      berec_decision_3:
        paragraph_1 : "In June 2016, BEREC plans to publish its draft guidelines and launch a public consultation. However, BEREC's procedural rules say that the public only has twenty working days to respond and the Regulation says that BEREC needs to publish its final guidelines on 30 August 2016. That means that citizens will only have one month to respond to the consultation and BEREC will only have a few weeks to process the (potentially thousands of) comments, draft updates to its guidelines and then go through the administrative processes to formally agree to any changes that it makes to the draft."

      berec_decision_5:
        headline: "This is a crucial moment: This is the step where big successes were achieved in the United States and India. Therefore, we have to continue pushing for real net neutrality by convincing the regulators about the value of a free and open Internet."
        paragraph_1: "Regulators need to equip themselves with the tools to enforce net neutrality. In Save The Internet, we think BEREC will not have enough time to process and duly take into account potentially tens of thousands of responses (the US telecoms regulator received 3.7 million responses to its consultation!). We can redress the balance by enabling everybody to properly contribute to the guidelines in a more efficient way."
        paragraph_2: "Recently, BEREC organised face-to-face meetings with stakeholder groups. We have translated the questions that BEREC asked stakeholders (<a href="https://edri.org/edris-first-input-on-net-neutrality-guidelines/">see here</a> and <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/rekindling-net-neutrality-our-meeting-with-eus-telecoms-regulators/">here</a>) in those meetings into plain English and added few others when we felt this was necessary."

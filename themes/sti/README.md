## Save The Internet Theme

 This theme is made with gulp and Hugo Skeleton, a supersimple theme for rapid website development with [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).

 Look how easy it is to use:

 `$ gulp`

## Features
- Layout templates based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
- Simple gulp workflow:
  - SASS Transpiler, Autoprefixer and Minifier.
  - JS Linter and Minifier.
  - Watch by default
- Boilerplate for SASS code organization inspired by the [Sass Guidelines project](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).
- No over-engineering.

## Workflow
Please make sure that you have `npm` [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), see README in root folder.


## Running
See README in root folder


## Project structure
The project follows the structure when [creating a new Hugo theme](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/creating-a-new-theme/). You should be familiar with the files when you finished the (excellent) tutorial. Additionally there is a `src` folder which contains all the JS and SCSS source files and some configuration files.
